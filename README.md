<h1>Dan Batchelor</h1>
<h4>Completed April 2021</h4>
<br>
<p>I worked with Dan to get an idea of website designs he liked, and what he wanted visitors to the site to be able to see and do. As we worked through the design I added in more functionality so that users could see more of his portfolio work by type and filter content by projects.</p>
<p>This site was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, with some PHP for the contact form</p>
